      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just months ago, I was over, thinking about suicide on a daily basis and shuttling from project to project.
I had moved from an idiot-proof developer job to a solution architect job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go is somewhat different in terms of exception handling than Java or Python, for example.
This can sometimes be a bit special, if you also want to find errors that are not caught by the method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>package main import( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; ) func main() { fmt.Println(&amp;#39;Peek-a-boo, here I am....&amp;#39;) } In this blog, I will put down from time to time for me personally findings, lament about development topics and write nonsense. I had there again on it lust. This is a blog like any other.
I am an enthusiastic Go developer and (uninspired) Java developer. From time to time I run my German language vlog on Youtube.</description>
