      <title>Today I Learned - Use Go Docs Offline</title>
      <link>https://skalski.github.io/posts/today-i-learned-use-go-docs-offline/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go has plentiful documentation online, but sometimes using a search engine to find the right thing in go can be tough. Go has docs at the command line though. On the first glance, it saves a lot of time. Also when you work sometimes without Internet Connection or don&amp;rsquo;t want to use a Hotspot.
For me this sometimes happens on the Ferry or when we go by boat at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just months ago, I was over, thinking about suicide on a daily basis and shuttling from project to project.
I had moved from an idiot-proof developer job to a solution architect job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exception Handling With Go</title>
      <link>https://skalski.github.io/posts/execption-execption-handling-with-go/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go is somewhat different in terms of exception handling than Java or Python, for example.
This can sometimes be a bit special, if you also want to find errors that are not caught by the method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>package main import( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; ) func main() { fmt.Println(&amp;#39;Peek-a-boo, here I am....&amp;#39;) } In this blog, I will put down from time to time for me personally findings, lament about development topics and write nonsense. I had there again on it lust. This is a blog like any other.
I am an enthusiastic Go developer and (uninspired) Java developer. From time to time I run my German language vlog on Youtube.</description>
