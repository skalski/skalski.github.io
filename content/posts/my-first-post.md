In this blog, I will put down from time to time for me personally findings, lament about development topics and write nonsense.
I had there again on it lust. This is a blog like any other.

I am an enthusiastic Go developer and (uninspired) Java developer. From time to time I run my German language vlog on Youtube.

There is nothing more to say... a guy with a github repo...
